# Vanilla Node REST API

### About

This project covers the creation of a full CRUD REST API using only Vanilla JavaScript, without the use of Express. This is mostly for learning/experimental purposes, as you would definitely want to save yourself a bunch of time and utilize Express (or something similar) in a production environment.

### Routes

```

GET      /api/products
POST     /api/products
GET      /api/products/:id
PUT      /api/products/:id
DELETE   /api/products/:id


```
